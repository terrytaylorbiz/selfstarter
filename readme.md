This repo includes docs that I wrote for a recent client that demonstrate how I am a self starter. I have deleted any text/screenshots from the docs that might contain confidential info, and all of this work was done on my personal PC (the docs contain many screenshots from examples I did).

I was writing payment facilitator documents for potential client partners. This work went much quicker than expected, so I had some free time. There was vague talk about creating a partner portal in 6 months (this was not to be my task), so I started to do some research on possible portal tech.  I had no assistance and was starting from near 0.

1. I first researched a lot of tools (doing hands-on examples wherever possible). The original doc was doc_portal.docx. 

2. I realized that I needed to focus on chapter 4 of that doc. So I split the doc into 3_doc_portal_ch13567.docx and 2_doc_portal_ch4.docx (chapter 4 only). I then focused on chapter 4.

3. I decided that a React-based portal was a good bet. So I did some hands-on learning for React. The details are in 1b_partner_portal_demo_react_firebase.docx (I figured that others might appreciate such info).

4. I created a short markdown cheat sheet (as requested by the client) 1a_markdown_tutorial_cheat_sheet.docx.

5. I found a suitable website at openpowerquality.org whose source files were open source and on GIT. I used these sources as a basis to create a portal. Details are described in 1_doc_portal_demo_docusaurus.docx.

6. I create __readme_first.docx as a summary of the documentation I created.

This portal was deployed by the client (with the payfac docs in markdown) and worked very well. So the portal was up and running before they even planned to start working on it.

This is how I work.
