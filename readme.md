An example of my self-starter working style

In 2019 the team I was working with planned to create an API documentation portal. The exact details of what the portal would look like had still not been determined. My assigned tasks (writing API docs) had been going much quicker than expected, so in my free time I started to research various tools that I thought might be useful for the portal.

The following describes what I did and the documents I created along the way (I removed any possibly confidential information from the documents before posting to GitHub).

1. I first researched a lot of tools (doing hands-on examples wherever possible). The original doc was doc_portal.docx. The tools I liked the most were Apigee, Postman and SoapUI. At first I thought the portal would include a complete Swagger-style API website with authorization. 

2. Later it was decided that the first version of the portal would be very simple. So I realized that I needed to focus only on chapter 4 of doc_portal.docx. So I split that doc into 3_doc_portal_ch13567.docx and 2_doc_portal_ch4.docx (chapter 4 only). I then focused on chapter 4.

3. I decided that a React-based portal was a good bet. So I did some hands-on learning for React. The details are in 1b_partner_portal_demo_react_firebase.docx (I figured the team might appreciate such info).

4. I then created a short markdown cheat sheet (as requested by the team leader) 1a_markdown_tutorial_cheat_sheet.docx.

5. I found a suitable website at openpowerquality.org whose source files were open source and on Git. I used these sources as a basis to create a portal. I ported the payfac docs to markdown. Details are described in 1_doc_portal_demo_docusaurus.docx.

6. I created __readme_first.docx to summarize the documentation I created.

This portal was up and running before the team had originally planned to start working on it.
