An example of my self-starter working style

May 11, 2020

In 2019 the team I was working with planned to create an API documentation portal. The exact details of what the portal would look like had still not been determined. My assigned tasks (writing API docs) had been going much quicker than expected, so in my free time I started to research various tools that I thought might be useful for the portal. 

The following describes what I did and the documents I created along the way (I removed any possibly confidential information from the documents before posting to GitHub).

1. I first researched a lot of tools (doing hands-on examples wherever possible). The original doc was doc_portal.docx. The tools I liked the most were Apigee, Postman and SoapUI. 

2. I then realized that I needed to focus on chapter 4 of that doc. So I split that doc into 3_doc_portal_ch13567.docx and 2_doc_portal_ch4.docx (chapter 4 only). I then focused on chapter 4.

3. I decided that a React-based portal was a good bet. So I did some hands-on learning for React. The details are in 1b_partner_portal_demo_react_firebase.docx (I figured the client might appreciate such info).

4. I then created a short markdown cheat sheet (as requested by the client) 1a_markdown_tutorial_cheat_sheet.docx.

5. I found a suitable website at openpowerquality.org whose source files were open source and on GIT. I used these sources as a basis to create a portal. I ported the payfac docs to markdown. Details are described in 1_doc_portal_demo_docusaurus.docx.

6. I created __readme_first.docx to summarize the documentation I created. I put all the docs on the client server.

This portal was deployed by the client and worked very well. The portal was up and running before they even planned to start working on it.
